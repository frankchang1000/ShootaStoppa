# ShooterStopper [DEMO VIDEO](https://youtu.be/I2G8XEkXiqo)

Ensuring **safety** for students using live security feeds and advanced AI.

*School shootings have devastated America in the last few decades by taking away innocent lives of children. In these past weeks, it seems that the school shooting cases have escalated tremendously. We developed ShooterStopper as a resource friendly and efficient program which uses artificial intelligence to inform schools when a weapon is detected by a security camera.*

## Why ShooterStopper‚ùì

**June 3rd is National Gun Violence Day** and our team wanted to spread awareness by creating ShooterStopper to prevent more innocent lives from being lost due to school shootings. Futhermore, we want to prevent the grief that loved ones of victims experience from the irreversible damage.

</p>

The Everytown Research Organization conveys the absurd amount of shootings in the past decade, we are targeting to reduce the number of school shootings that contain casualties and injuries to reinforce the idea of going to school safely students and parents.

## Installation and Usage ‚úÖ

Before beginning installation, ShooterStopper wants to ensure the privacy of our users and want to highlight that we detect **objects rather than people.**

### Installation ‚öôÔ∏è

First follow the following steps **using POWERSHELL and not CMD** (works on Windows 10 and 11; different commands required for Unix and Linux systems).

```python
git clone https://github.com/frankchang1000/ShooterStopper.git
cd ShooterStopper
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
$env:DATABASE_URL = "postgresql://frank:w1hEwgGgIXYJrFFCMUIs-w@free-tier11.gcp-us-east1.cockroachlabs.cloud:26257/defaultdb?sslmode=verify-full&options=--cluster%3Dshootastoppa-1042" # This command is only required when using CockroachDB and will be deprecated in 10 days.
python flask_app.py
```

Once you have completed these steps; go to [localhost:5000](localhost:5000) to access the website.

### Computational Requirements ü§Ø

Your computer MUST have an **Nvidia GPU** and it MUST have a compute capability of at least 7.0 to run our software; otherwise you stand a chance damaging ur teeny weeny laptop.

To check your GPU's compute capability, run the following command in CMD:

```cmd
D:\>nvidia-smi

+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| NVIDIA-SMI 511.65       Driver Version: 511.65       CUDA Version: 11.6     |
|-------------------------------+----------------------+----------------------+
| GPU  Name            TCC/WDDM | Bus-Id        Disp.A | Volatile Uncorr. ECC |
| Fan  Temp  Perf  Pwr:Usage/Cap|         Memory-Usage | GPU-Util  Compute M. |
|                               |                      |               MIG M. |
|===============================+======================+======================|

|                               |                      |                  N/A |
+-------------------------------+----------------------+----------------------+
```

## Challenges üëé

When we first planned ShooterStopper, we originally wanted to implement the Ring API in our project that we later found inaccessible. We improvised and used webcam cameras to simulate a security camera, but we soon found the resolution and frames of the camera quality were poor as we found some input lag.

Furthermore, our project has the capability to expand to IP Cameras for a more realistic security solution; however we were unable to implement those as a result of time constraints.

## Accomplishments üéÜ

Despite our setbacks, we are proud to create a working product that delivers our stance on how to defend school shootings as school shootings have been a major conflict this decade. We are proud to face this problem with an efficent and working method with our AI training and model that can detect items instantly and compare how simular an item is to an weapon.

We also take pride in implementing **CockroachDB's** database hosting service and APIs in our project.

## How can we Improve? ü§î

In the future, ShooterStopper hopes to expand by implementing an instant notifying of law enforcement or police when a gun is spotted. Also in the future, we wish to use better cameras so we can have a detection on a weapon for 10+ frames on camera. As for now, the input delay and processing time makes movement blurry and laggy. We also hope to use TFlite for improved tracking speed.
