## Why ShooterStopper‚ùì
Because June 3rd is National Gun Violence Day, our team wanted to spread awareness by creating ShooterStopper. As the innocent lives that are lost due to school shootings are irreplaceable, we want to prevent further school shootings to ensure the safety of students everywhere.

</p>
As the Everytown Research Organization conveys the absurd amount of shootings in the past decade, we are targeting to reduce the amount of casualties and injuries to reinforce the idea of going to school safely for both the parents and the students.







## Installation and Usage ‚úÖ
Before beginning installation, ShooterStopper wants to ensure the privacy of our users and want to highlight that we detect **objects rather than people.**

## Accomplishments üéÜ

As school shootings have been a major conflict this decade, we are proud to create an efficent and working method to detect hand held weapons to prevent tragedies.
