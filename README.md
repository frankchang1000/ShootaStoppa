## Why ShooterStopper‚ùì

**June 3rd is National Gun Violence Day** and our team wanted to spread awareness by creating ShooterStopper to prevent more innocent lives from being lost due to school shootings. Futhermore, we want to prevent the grief that loved ones of victims experience from the irreversible damage.

</p>

The Everytown Research Organization conveys the absurd amount of shootings in the past decade, we are targeting to reduce the number of school shootings that contain casualties and injuries to reinforce the idea of going to school safely students and parents.

## Installation and Usage ‚úÖ

Before beginning installation, ShooterStopper wants to ensure the privacy of our users and want to highlight that we detect **objects rather than people.**

### Installation ‚öôÔ∏è

First follow the following steps **using POWERSHELL and not CMD** (works on Windows 10 and 11; different commands required for Unix and Linux systems).

```python
git clone https://github.com/frankchang1000/ShooterStopper.git
cd ShooterStopper
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py
```

## Challenges üëé

When we first planned ShooterStopper, we originally wanted to implement the Ring API in our project that we later found inaccessible. We improvised and used webcam cameras to simulate a security camera, but we soon found the resolution and frames of the camera quality were poor as we found some input lag.



## Accomplishments üéÜ

Despite our setbacks, we are proud to create a working product that delivers our stance on how to defend school shootings as school shootings have been a major conflict this decade. We are proud to face this problem with an efficent and working method with our AI training and model that can detect items instantly and compare how simular an item is to an weapon.

We also take pride in implementing **CockroachDB's** database in our project.

## How can we Improve? ü§î

In the future, ShooterStopper hopes to expand by implementing an instant notifying of law enforcement or police when a gun is spotted. Also in the future, we wish to use better cameras so we can have a detection on a weapon for 10+ frames on camera. As for now, the input delay makes movement blurry and laggy. We also hope to use TFlite for improved tracking speed.
