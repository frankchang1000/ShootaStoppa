## Why ShooterStopper‚ùì
As June 3rd is National Gun Violence Day, our team wanted to spread awareness by creating ShooterStopper. We want to prevent the innocent lives that are lost due to school shootings and the grief that the victims loved ones experience as the damage irreversible.

</p>
As the Everytown Research Organization conveys the absurd amount of shootings in the past decade, we are targeting to reduce the number of school shootings that contain casualties and injuries to reinforce the idea of going to school safely students and parents.

## Installation and Usage ‚úÖ
Before beginning installation, ShooterStopper wants to ensure the privacy of our users and want to highlight that we detect **objects rather than people.**

## Challenges üëé
When we first planned ShooterStopper, we originally wanted to implement the Ring API in our project that we later found inaccessible. We improvised and used webcam cameras to simulate a security camera, but we soon found the resolution and frames of the camera quality were poor as we found some input lag.



## Accomplishments üéÜ
Despite our setbacks, we are proud to create a working product that delivers our stance on how to defend school shootings as school shootings have been a major conflict this decade. We are proud to face this problem with an efficent and working method with our AI training and model that can detect items instantly and compare how simular an item is to an weapon.

We also take pride in implementing **CockroachDB's** database in our project.

## How can we Improve? ü§î
In the future, ShooterStopper hopes to expand by implementing an instant notifying of law enforcement or police when a gun is spotted.
